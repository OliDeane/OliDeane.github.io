This unit is designed as an introduction to a range of Data Science topics and techniques and a chance for students to gain some practical experience with applying these to real data. It covers topics such as: ethics and privacy, data ingress, storage, wrangling, fusion, exploration and visualization and deployment of data science systems. I work as a teaching assistant and a supervisor to several groups during the coursework assessment period.
